# Branching Life Hack

.EM currently doesn't support branching out of the box, but here's a cool life hack for handling branching in multiple projects.

Instead of adding a project name as is, you can add it with an alias such as -prod, -test, or -dev. This allows you to manage different environments within the same project effectively.

Example:

Production environment:
```bash copy
dotem add my_project-prod /path/to/project/.env
```
Test environment:
```bash copy
dotem add my_project-test /path/to/project/.env
```
Development environment:
```bash copy
dotem add my_project-dev /path/to/project/.env
```
----

For switching between environments, you can use the `.em pull <project-name> <path-to-env>` command with the alias you've set.

This way, you can easily switch between different environments by referencing the appropriate alias.
