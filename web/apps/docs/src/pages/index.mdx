# Introduction

Welcome to DotEM, your dynamic environment management tool. DotEM simplifies the way developers handle `.env` files across multiple projects, ensuring you always have the right settings at your fingertips, whether you're in development, testing, or production environments.

**Warning:** This software is not perfect. In some cases, you might overwrite important data. Before running commands such as `push` and `pull`, please think carefully about the potential impact on your environment and data. Always ensure you have backups of your important `.env` files and other critical data.
